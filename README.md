# WebKit RSpec Formatter

WebKit RSpec Formatter is a webkit-aware pretty formatter for RSpec. It was
written to take advantage of some of the advanced features of the webkit HTML
engine, like the one TextMate uses for its output.

You can check out the current development source with Mercurial from the [main repo](http://repo.deveiate.org/webkit-rspec-formatter "mercurial repo"), or if you prefer Git, via [the Github project](http://github.com/ged/webkit-rspec-formatter "ged's webkit-rspec-formatter at master - GitHub").

The [project page](http://deveiate.org/projects/WebKit-RSpec-Formatter) is 
also likely to have more details.
